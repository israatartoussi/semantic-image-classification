# Semantic Image Classification

This project integrates **YOLO** for object detection with **RDF knowledge graphs**, **ConceptNet**, and **SPARQL queries** to enable semantic-level image understanding.

## üîç Overview

Traditional image classification models focus on detecting objects at the visual level. This project enhances image interpretation by linking detected objects to **semantic knowledge** using:

- **YOLO**: Real-time object detection
- **RDF & SPARQL**: Represent and query structured knowledge
- **ConceptNet**: Provides common-sense knowledge
- **Reasoning Layer**: Infers semantic meaning from visual inputs

## üß† Key Features

- Detects multiple objects in images using YOLO
- Maps objects to semantic concepts using RDF triples
- Queries relationships using SPARQL
- Enhances reasoning with external sources like ConceptNet

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- YOLOv5 (or YOLOv4, based on your implementation)
- RDFLib (for RDF handling)
- SPARQLWrapper
- ConceptNet API
- OpenCV (optional, for visualization)
